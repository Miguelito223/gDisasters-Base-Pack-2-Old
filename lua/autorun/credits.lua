--[[Credits  (18/02/2018)

Business Cat and Tempest: they've spend countless amounts of hours on development and refinement of their work that I, personally, consider to be their greatest contribution to the community of GMod. It was a pleasure working with them throughout the past two years.

Dr Vrej: he contibuted programming ideas and suggestions that were crucial to the development of gDisasters.

Maxx: ??? I guess his promises of gDisasters maps was kinda, uh, helpful.

DmitRex, Something Wild, Sam Za Nemesis: these three people helped me out greatly when I was starting to learn HLSL to create shaders for Source Engine. I learnt a lot from them and their work, and I doubt my start into shaders would've been as good as without them.

Bird and Valviz: group moderation duties

Jimmywells: helped bring this project from the void
